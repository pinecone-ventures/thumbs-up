# Getting Started Guide

Welcome to the thumbs-up documentation feedback system! This guide will help you get started with collecting feedback on your documentation.

## What is thumbs-up?

thumbs-up is a lightweight, GitHub-native system for collecting feedback on your documentation. It uses GitHub Issues to store feedback and GitHub Actions to generate a dashboard showing which docs need improvement.

## Installation

### Step 1: Add the GitHub Action

Create a workflow file at `.github/workflows/doc-feedback.yml` that will aggregate feedback and generate your dashboard.

### Step 2: Add the Widget to Your Docs

Use the widget generator CLI to create feedback widgets for your documentation:

```bash
npm run widget -- docs/your-file.md
```

Then copy and paste the generated snippet at the bottom of your Markdown file.

### Step 3: Enable Issue Templates (Optional)

Add the issue template from `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/doc-feedback.yml` to provide a structured form for feedback.

## Usage

### Collecting Feedback

Readers of your documentation can click the thumbs up or thumbs down links at the bottom of any page. This opens a prefilled GitHub issue that they can submit.

### Viewing Feedback

All feedback is stored as GitHub Issues with the `doc-feedback` label. You can:

- View issues directly in your GitHub repository
- Use the automated dashboard (generated by the GitHub Action)
- Filter by `thumbs-up` or `thumbs-down` labels

## Benefits

- **Zero Infrastructure**: Everything runs on GitHub
- **Transparent**: All feedback is publicly visible in Issues
- **Simple**: No servers, databases, or external services
- **Free**: Uses only GitHub's free features

## Next Steps

- Check out the [API Reference](./api-reference.md) for more details
- View your dashboard at `docs/Dashboard.md` (auto-generated)
- Customize the widget appearance if needed
